# English-to-French-German-and-Arabic-language-traslator

This Python code utilizes the tkinter library to create a graphical user interface for translating English sentences into various languages. It prompts users to input an English sentence and select the desired output language from a dropdown menu. Upon clicking the "Find Translation" button, it searches for the input sentence in a file named 'english.txt' and retrieves the corresponding translation from language-specific files such as 'french.txt', 'german.txt', etc. If the selected language is not available or marked as "Other," it opens a Google Translate window, where users can manually input the desired language code. The code then utilizes the Google Translate API to provide the translation. Error handling ensures proper input validation and notification of any issues. Overall, the code offers a user-friendly interface for language translation, incorporating both predefined translations and Google Translate for broader language support.
